Sure, tres leches (which translates to &#34;three milks&#34;) is an ultra moist cake, but what if we made everything from scratch AND introduced a fourth &#34;milk&#34;? Applying a crumb coat means your finished cake will never reveal its inner issues: the crumbly side, dimpled top The chilled cake is now ready for its crumb coat, whose ultimate goal is to capture and trap any stray crumbs As well, you want to fill any small divots and even out any slight depressions. To crumb coat your cake, put some of your buttercream into a separate, smaller bowl ‚Äî that way you won&#39;t risk getting crumbs in the frosting you&#39;ll use for the final, perfect coat. Use an offset spatula to add a small amount of buttercream to the top of your cake, then smooth it out with your bench scraper.
